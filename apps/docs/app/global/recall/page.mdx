# Recall Functionality

Enhance your surveys with the Recall Functionality to create more engaging and personalized experiences. This feature allows users to dynamically include responses from previous answers in subsequent questions or descriptions, adapting the survey content based on individual responses.

### **How to Insert Recall References**

<Note>
  The recall functionality is disabled on the first question of the survey since there’s no preceding question
  to recall
</Note>

**Pre-requisite:** Ensure the answer you wish to recall precedes the question in which it will be recalled. Here’s an example of setting up the first question:

<MdxImage
  src={StepOne}
  alt="Choose a link survey template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
/>

### **Steps to Initiate Recall**

1. **Initiate Recall**: In the survey editor, type **`@`** in the question or description field where you want to insert a recall. This triggers a dropdown menu listing all preceding questions.

<MdxImage
  src={StepTwo}
  alt="Choose a link survey template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
/>

2. **Select a Question**: Navigate through the dropdown to choose your question. The first question is automatically focused, making it easy to select by pressing **`ENTER`**. Once selected, the question becomes a linked placeholder within the text field.

### **Configuring Fallback Options**

To ensure the survey remains coherent when a response is missing (or the question is optional), you can set a fallback option.

<MdxImage
  src={StepThree}
  alt="Choose a link survey template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
/>

1. **Access Fallback Settings**: Click the linked placeholder to open the configuration pop-up for fallback settings.
2. **Set Fallback Text**: Input the fallback text that should appear if the recalled question lacks a response. This text ensures smooth survey progression.

### **Example of Recall Usage**

For example, you might structure a survey about favorite fruits as follows:

- **Question 1**: "What is your favorite fruit?"
- **Question 2**: "Why do you like `@What is your favorite fruit?` so much?"

If "Question 1" is unanswered, you can set a fallback like "the fruit" to make "Question 2" read: "Why do you like the fruit so much?"

### **User Experience**

If a respondent answers “Mango” to the first question, the recall functionality automatically adjusts the following question to "Why is Mango your favorite?”

<MdxImage
  src={StepFour}
  alt="Choose a link survey template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
/>

As you can see, the questions that use this recall automatically use the response value:

<MdxImage
  src={StepFive}
  alt="Choose a link survey template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
/>

<MdxImage
  src={StepSix}
  alt="Choose a link survey template"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
/>

### **Visual Indicators in UI**

When setting up your questions, the UI will visually indicate where recalls are used:

- **Recall Indicators**: Linked questions will be highlighted with a light grey background in the survey editor, making it clear where dynamic content is being utilized.
- **Fallback Indicators**: Any fallbacks set will also be displayed in a subtle yet distinct manner, ensuring you are aware of all conditional text paths in your survey.

### Response Summary Page

On the Formbricks dashboard, summary responses and individual response cards reflect recalled information, ensuring data coherence and enhancing analysis.

- Summary Tab

  <MdxImage
    src={StepSeven}
    alt="Choose a link survey template"
    quality="100"
    className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
  />

- Response Card:

  <MdxImage
    src={StepEight}
    alt="Choose a link survey template"
    quality="100"
    className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
  />

## **Conclusion**

Recall Functionality in Formbricks surveys allows for a conversational and customized survey experience that enhances engagement and improves the quality of feedback. By integrating previous responses into new questions, you create a more interactive and relevant environment for respondents.

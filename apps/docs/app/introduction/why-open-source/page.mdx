#### Introduction

# Why is Formbricks open source?

A lot has been written on why open source software beats proprietary software in all aspects - except for value capture for the company investing into its development. While this definitely poses a challenge for a profit-oriented organisation, it's also an interesting opportunity: Due to the open nature of our platform, it's usage is significantly higher. Capturing a small part of the value our platform generates translates into a decently-sized business.

| Advantage             | Open Source Software                                         | Proprietary Software                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Privacy**      | Self-host for maximum control over data                      | Dependent on thrid party data processor.                         |
| **Cost**              | Often free or significantly lower cost.                      | Typically requires a purchase or subscription.                   |
| **Customizability**   | Code can be modified to meet specific needs.                 | Limited customization, restricted to developer's features.       |
| **Security**          | Frequent community reviews identify vulnerabilities quickly. | Security updates depend on vendor's schedule and interest.       |
| **Flexibility**       | Supports a wide range of applications and integrations.      | Designed for specific environments and integrations.             |
| **Community Support** | Large, active communities offer free support and resources.  | Paid customer support with limited community help.               |
| **Innovation**        | Fosters rapid innovation through community contributions.    | Innovations depend on vendor's vision and development team.      |
| **Licensing**         | Permissive licenses allow broad usage and modification.      | Strict licensing with limited redistribution rights.             |
| **Independence**      | Not dependent on a single vendor or developer.               | Vendor lock-in can limit future choices.                         |
| **Transparency**      | Full visibility into the code base and development.          | Closed-source, code is hidden from users.                        |
| **Interoperability**  | Supports open standards, ensuring interoperability.          | Often requires additional software or plugins for compatibility. |
